# Lotus JSX

NOTE: The work on the CEP framework has been moved to https://github.com/iconifyit/cep-boilerplate

Lotus JSX is a work-in-progress and labor of love. The goal is to create a framework for building Adobe Illustrator ExtendScript applications. The JavaScript capabilities in Illustrator are very powerful and offer great tools for automating repetitive tasks to speed up your workflow. But most designers and end users are not well-versed in coding, much less coding for Adobe Illustrator's JSX APIs. Lotus JSX will attempt to normalize and simplify developing Script applications and make the process more efficient.
